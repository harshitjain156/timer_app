# Timer App ‚è∞

A modern, customizable multi-timer app built with React Native and Expo. Supports multiple named timers, categories, progress visualization, history, dark/light themes, and local notifications. Designed for productivity, workouts, study sessions, and more.

---

## üöÄ Features

- **Multiple Timers:** Create timers with custom names, durations, and categories.
- **Category Grouping:** Timers are grouped by category with expandable/collapsible sections.
- **Timer Management:** Start, pause, reset, and delete individual timers. Bulk actions for all timers in a category.
- **Progress Visualization:** See progress bars and percentages for each timer.
- **Timer History:** View completed timer sessions with name, category, and completion time. Export history as JSON.
- **Customizable Categories:** Add/delete categories. Only non-empty categories are shown.
- **Theme Support:** Toggle between light and dark themes.
- **Custom Alerts:** Enable halfway and completion alerts for each timer. Get local notifications, even in the background.
- **Persistence:** All timers, categories, and history are saved using AsyncStorage.
- **Cross-Platform:** Works on Android and iOS. Tested for compatibility.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

This project is fully modularized for maintainability and scalability:

- **app/**: All screens, using file-based routing (e.g., Home, History, Add/Edit Timer, Categories).
- **components/**: Reusable UI components, further organized:
  - **timer_list/**: TimerList, TimerCard, TimerControls, CategorySection, BulkActions, TimerForm, etc.
  - **shared/**: Common UI elements (Card, PrimaryButton, SecondaryButton, ProgressBar, EmptyState, etc.).
- **context/**: Global state management using React Context:
  - **ThemeContext**: App-wide light/dark theme and color palette.
  - **TimerContext**: Timers and categories, with all CRUD logic and persistence.
  - **HistoryContext**: Timer history, with add, clear, and export logic.
- **notification/**: All notification logic (scheduling, canceling, initialization) in one place.
- **utils/**: Utility functions (e.g., time formatting, grouping, AsyncStorage helpers).
- **types/**: Centralized TypeScript types and interfaces (e.g., Timer, HistoryEntry) for type safety and DRY code.
- **assets/**: Fonts and images.
- **app_apk/**: Place your built APK here for sharing.

**Key Modularization Highlights:**
- All business logic and state are managed via context providers (theme, timers, history).
- All UI is broken into small, focused, and reusable components.
- Shared UI and utility logic are centralized for easy reuse and consistency.
- Types/interfaces are defined in one place and imported everywhere.
- Notification logic is fully separated and initialized at app startup.

This structure makes the app easy to extend, test, and maintain.
